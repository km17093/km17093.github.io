I became a MIS major because when I first got into college I had no idea what I wanted to do. Because of this, I decided to work towards a business degree as it sounded like a good degree if I wanted to make money. However, I found out later on that I was interested in cybersecurity. So, when I found out about the MIS degree it was perfect. I didn't have to take a ton of extra classes as the business core classes are the same for every major. But if I transferred to CS, I would've pretty much wasted 2-3 years of college.
