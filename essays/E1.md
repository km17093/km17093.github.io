BrowserHistory1 was definitely the hardest out of the three and it shows because it took me 16 minutes (16:23) to complete, while the other two took much less time. It was the hardest as it required the most coding (and knowledge). It was also the base for our next two WODs, which made them much easier. I also learned the most from the first WOD, as I had to really review the readings over and over to get through it. But once I got it down and completed WOD BrowserHistory1, I felt like I learned a lot in terms of how the code works. This made the next two WODs much easier, as I better understood the purpose on the code we used. I completed BrowserHistory2 in less than 4 minutes (3:52) and BrowserHistory3 in 7:27. So, I finished these WODs much faster, but they still weren't that easy. I learned a lot from these WODs as I never utilized css before.
