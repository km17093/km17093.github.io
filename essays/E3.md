(WOD 5.1 SmartPhoneProducts1 with variables) [https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/050.variables_data_types/experience-SmartPhoneProducts1_variables.html] is pretty self explanatory. Instead of using the original code in the sections, we made variables with that code and called the variables in the sections. 
To be honest, this WOD was really easy. It was pretty much just copy and pasting stuff. We just replaced our existing code with code given in the instructions. 
The only thing that was confusing was that we had to put the scripts in the head, when we could've just started by creating the javascript file and putting the scripts in there. 
Or we could've used <script></script> in the head. It just seemed redundant. To prepare for this WOD, I just read over the instructions a few times. I didn't really prepare for this one due to how simple it was. 
4. I think I could've prepared more to increase my speed (6:10), but overall I did well. Maybe I should still try to prepare more for WODs though, as I'm sure they will get more difficult the further we get into the semester.
